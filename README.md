3. Improve Business Reputation: By effectively managing and minimizing flight cancellations, Flyzy and its partner airlines can build a reputation for reliability and punctuality, attracting more customers and business opportunities.

4. Increase Profitability: Minimizing flight cancellations will lead to increased revenue generation as flights will operate more efficiently, reducing revenue losses due to

cancellations and missed opportunities.
