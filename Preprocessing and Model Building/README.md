# Task -Preprocessing and Model Building

To predict flight cancellations using Logistic Regression, the dataset will be split into training and test sets. Categorical variables will be encoded for model comprehension, and feature scaling will ensure uniformity in feature ranges. The Logistic Regression model will be built and evaluated using appropriate metrics with the test data to assess its predictive performance.

Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. Then, build a Logistic Regression model to predict flight cancellations. This involves:



● Encoding categorical variables: Some of the columns in the dataset are categorical. These need to be encoded into a format that can be understood by the model.

● Feature Scaling: The ranges of the features in the dataset are quite different. Scaling the features to a similar range can help the model perform better.

● Model Building: Build a Logistic Regression model using the training data.

● Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and the test data.
