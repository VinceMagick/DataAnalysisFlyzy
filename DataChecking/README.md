# Data Checking

Before developing the predictive model for hotel cancellations, we will conduct preliminary data analysis. This involves checking for missing values, identifying outliers, and ensuring appropriate data types for each column. Handling missing values and outliers strategically will ensure a reliable dataset for accurate modeling.

● First, load the dataset and check for:

● Missing values: Use the appropriate function to check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decide on the best strategy to handle them based on the nature of the data.

● Outliers: Check for outliers in the dataset. These can be identified using various techniques, such as boxplots, scatterplots, or Z-scores. If there are any outliers, decide on the best strategy to handle them.

● Data types: Check the data type of each column. Ensure that the data type is appropriate for the data it represents.
