# Task -Build Other Classification Models

Multiple classification models, including Decision Tree and Random Forest, will be built to predict flight cancellations. Each model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics and the test data. By comparing the models, we aim to identify the most effective approach for flight cancellation prediction, considering trade-offs in interpretability, complexity, and computational requirements.

Build other classification models to predict flight cancellations and compare their performance. This may involve:

● Building other models: Build other classification models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest

● Model Evaluation: Evaluate each model using appropriate metrics and the test data.

● Model Comparison: Compare the performance of all the models. Discuss the trade-offs between them and decide on the best model.

➔ Always start by understanding the business objective before jumping into the data. This will guide your analysis and help you make meaningful conclusions.

➔ Take time to understand the data and the relationships between different features. This can give you insights into the data and the problem at hand, and can also inform your feature engineering and model building.

➔ When building models, start with a simple model as a baseline, and then move on to more complex models. This will give you a sense of how much improvement the more complex models are providing.

➔ When evaluating models, remember that accuracy is not the only metric. Consider other metrics like precision, recall etc
