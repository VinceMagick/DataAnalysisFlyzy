# Task -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In preparation for building the predictive model, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted on the dataset. This will involve obtaining descriptive statistics, visualizing data distributions, exploring feature relationships through scatter plots or correlation matrices, and investigating how features relate to the target variable to extract valuable insights for accurate modeling.

Perform an EDA on the dataset to understand the data better and extract insights. This may involve:

● Descriptive Statistics: Use the appropriate function to get the descriptive statistics of the dataset.

● Distribution of data: Plot histograms or bar charts to see the distribution of data in each column.

● Relationship between features: Plot scatter plots, pair plots, or correlation matrices to see the relationship between different features.

● Relationship between features and target variable: Investigate how different features relate to the target variable.
